# XVDStrip
A simple python script designed to remove console specific info from Xbox Packages. (XVD, UWA). 
I have found newer versions of Xbox packages to now contain console specific info such as the serial and ODD model of the console it was first generated or downloaded to. This script is designed to remove that info to prevent tracking of shared packages.
